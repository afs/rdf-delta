title: RDF Delta - Replicating RDF Datasets
---

<b>** This project is going to be archived **</b>

RDF Delta is a system for recording and publishing changes to RDF
Datasets.

It is built on top of the idea of change logs:

* _RDF Patch_ -  a format for recording changes to an RDF Dataset
* _RDF Patch Log_ - organise patches in to a log of changes
to an RDF Dataset with HTTP access.

These can be useful in their own right.

RDF Patch Logs can be used for:

* Synchronized copies of a dataset - 2 or more copies of a single dataset for high
availability of the data.
* Incremental backup of a dataset.
* Recording changes
* Generate alerts based on changes, either to the dataset as a whole or
specific resources within the dataset.

Delta provides a server for RDF Patch Logs to support replicated
datasets.

See "[Delta](delta.html)" for a overview of the Delta system for
distributing changes to RDF datasets.
