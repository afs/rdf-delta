        RDF Patch is a file format for recording changes made to an RDF
        dataset. It can be used for replicating changes between multiple
        copies of the same dataset or as an incremental backups format.
      </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        RDF Patch is a file format for recording changes made to an RDF
        dataset. It can be used for replicating changes between multiple
        copies of the same dataset or as an incremental backups format.
      </p>
      <p>
        The design emphasizes deployment concerns such as scalability
        and efficient processing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>
        This section outlines some use cases for RDF patch.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>HTTP PATCH</h3>
        <p>
          The HTTP PATCH method, introduced
          in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789">RFC 5789</a> (March 2010),
          is for modification of a web resource by sending a description of the
          changes to the resource.  Changes are limited to that resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          SPARQL Update may not be suitable and follows a service oriented
          model of operation.  A more focused and light weight solution is
          given by RDF Patch.  For example, where the web resource is an
          RDF graph, not an RDF dataset.
        </p>
        <p>
          No new web resources can be created by RDF patch. Data can only
          be added and removed from an existing graph or dataset.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Incremental backup</h3>
        <p>
          With a large dataset, a full backups can take a significant
          amount of time and space; if taken on a live, then it may
          introduce significant load.  By keeping an RDF Patch file to
          record changes, there is an incremental backup that can be
          applied to the last full backup.  Such a record can be much
          smaller, and not a significant load on the system during peak
          times.
        </p>
        <p>
          By taking periodic full backups and recording changes as an RDF
          Patch as incremental backups between the full backup points, an
          up-to-date version of the data can be restored, including the
          latest changes.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Replica Maintenance</h3>
        <p>
          Suppose an SPARQL server is replicated for performance or
          resilience reasons.  Each server has a complete copy of the
          database.  While there are many other issues to consider, one
          aspect is to be able to update both databases in a consistent
          manner - that is, blank nodes within the dataset are treated
          identically.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Data Staging</h3>
        <p>
          One deployment architecture is to have a master database for
          staging the data which is not available to the
          public/application-facing publication servers.  The master
          database is updated, then the changes propagated to replicas that
          support the public/application-facing read-only workload.  The
          staging database may be subject to checking and validation of
          changes before release to the production publishing servers.  In
          order to keep the production servers exactly as the master
          database, an RDF Patch file can be used because it allows blank
          nodes to be replicated.
        </p>

      <h2>Illustrative Example</h2>
      <p>
        This examples delta adds a <tt>foaf:knows</tt> relationship, and
        changes the <tt>foaf:name</tt> triple for Bob.
        </p>
<pre class="box">
 A &lt;http://example.org/bob> &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Robert" .
 A &lt;http://example.org/bob> &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows> &lt;http://example/alice> .
 A &lt;http://example.org/alice> &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Alice" .
 D &lt;http://example.org/bob> &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Robert" .
 A &lt;http://example.org/bob> &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Bob" .</pre>

      <p>
        In RDF patch, the first column is the operation marker.
        <tt>A</tt> means "add" and <tt>D</tt> means "delete".
      </p>
      <p>
        The order in the file is significant - the changes happened in the
        order given so the first triple added with "Robert" as Bob's name
        is removed by the later delete when the name is changed from
        "Robert" to "Bob".
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>RDF Patch Details</h2>

      <p>
        An RDF Dataset is defined as a a set of a unnamed graph and zero or
        more named graphs.  For recording changes to these graphs, we
        record triples added or deleted to the default graph, and the quad
        for a named graph.  The "RDF Patch" format is based on a general
        format for "RDF tuples", which is not another serialization format
        for RDF or RDF Datasets.
      </p>
      <p>
        The format is rows of RDF terms (URIs, literals, bNodes), with each
        row ending in a "." (<tt>DOT</tt>).  Prefix names, SPARQL-styles variables
        and keywords (bare word without a ":" in them) are allowed.

      <p>
        Variables are not used by RDF Patch but other uses of RDF Tuples
        may define their use.
      </p>

      <p>
        <tt>#</tt> starts a comment and it runs until the end of line.
        Note that RDF Tuple rows are delimited by <tt>DOT</tt> and may have white
        space between the RDF terms, including newlines.
      </p>

      <p>RDF Tuples uses the following keywords:</p>
       <table class="simple">
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Keyword</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
           <tr>
            <td>
              <tt>R</tt>
            </td>
            <td>Repeat term from previous row</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><tt>U</tt></td>
            <td>Term undefined (not used by RDF Tuples)</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>RDF Patch puts a keyword in the first item of each row:</p>

      <table class="simple">
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Keyword</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <tt>A</tt>
            </td>
            <td>Add</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><tt>D</tt></td>
            <td>Delete</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>This is followed by 3 or 4 RDF terms; 3 for a triple, 4 for a quad.</p>

      <p>Using RDF Tuples, RDF Patch, has the following characteristics:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The unit being managed is an RDF Dataset, which is a collection
          of RDF graphs and used by SPARQL for query and for update.  RDF
          Patch can also be used to record changes to a single graph.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is streaming - changes can be applied as an RDF Patch file or
          stream read; it is not necessary to wait until the whole set of
          changes is seen before applying any of it.  Indeed, the patch
          must be applied in the order in the file to correctly apply
          changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Blank nodes are recorded as <tt>_:<i>id</i></tt> where <i>id</i> can be the
          system-internal identifier for the blank node.  This means that
          changes involving blank nodes can be replayed to get an identical
          datasets to the one where the changes were originally made.  This
          is RDF Patch's interpretation of the <tt>_:abc</tt> syntax;
          other uses of RDF Tuples may have different scoping rules for
          blank node labels.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Abbreviation, Compression and Readability</h3>

      <p>
        To remove repetition, the value of an element in a row can be the
        keyword R, meaning it is the same as the previous row.  It is an
        error if there is no such row.  This means repeated subjects,
        predicates or objects of changes do not need to re-output for each
        quad.  This may allow significant compression at very low CPU-cost.
        General compression, like gzip streams, may still be usefully
        applied.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a element in a row is undefined in some row, a U is used to mark
        this (not used in RDF Patch)
      </p>

      <p>
        Prefixed names are allowed (e.g. <tt>rdf:type</tt>) using Turtle style <tt>@prefix</tt> and expansion
        rules.
      </p>

      <p>
        Relative URIs are not allowed.  There is no <tt>@base</tt>.
      </p>

      <h2>RDF Tuples Format</h2>

      <p class="todo">@@Make formal</p>
      <p><i>Outline grammar</i></p>

      <p>
        This uses the grammar and tokens from RDF 1.1 Turtle and SPARQL
        1.1.
      </p>

      <p>
        White space is allowed between tokens and may be needed to distinguish
        tokens.
      </p>

      <p>
        Comments are start with <tt>'#'</tt> and  run to the end of the
        line.
      </p>

<pre class="box">
Term     = iri | BlankNode | literal
RowItem  = WORD | Term | VAR
Row      = RowItem* DOT

WORD    = PN_CHARS_BASE PN_LOCAL without allowing ':'    # Must start with a letter.
VAR     = (from SPARQL)</pre>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>RDF Patch Use of RDF Tuples</h2>

      <p class="todo">@@Make formal</p>
      <p>
        RDF patch uses RDF Tuples for triples or quads (N-Quad order).  It
        requires the first item in a row to be a keyword (<tt>A</tt>
        or <tt>D</tt>).
      </p>
      <p>
        After the first keyword <tt>RowItem</tt>, there are 3 or
        4 <tt>RowItem</tt>s which are either RDF Terms or the
        keyword <tt>R</tt>, for an RDF term repeated from the  last use in
        this row position.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blank node labels are treated as encoded internal system
        identifiers.  System may refuse to perform changes
        if they do not recognize the label format.
      </p>
      <p>
        RDF Patch does not allow <tt>VAR</tt>.
      </p>

<pre class="box">
A &lt;http://example/bob&gt; &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name&gt; "Bob" .</pre>

           <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789">HTTP PATCH (RFC
           578)</a> introduced a mechanism for sending changes to a web
           resources. The <a href="www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-http-rdf-update"
           >SPARQL Graph Store Protocol</a> mentions the use of HTTP Patch.
           RDF Patch is a suitable alternative to full SPARQL Update for
           the HTTP request body.

    <section>
      <h2>Canonical Patches</h2>

      <p>
        A further way in which the size of a diff file can be reduced is to
        only record changes that do have an effect of a change.  An RDF
        Dataset is set of quads, no duplicates, so if a quad is added that
        is already in the dataset, then no record is needed as no effective
        change occurs.  Similarly for deletes, if the quad does not exist,
        a delete action has no effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        A RDF patch that only records actual changes is said to be a <strong>canonical patch</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, testing before every insert or delete can be expensive or
        otherwise impractical and so this style is not required:
        </p>

<pre class="box">
A &lt;http://example/s&gt; &lt;http://example/p&gt; &lt;http://example/o&gt; &lt;http://example/g&gt; .
A &lt;http://example/s&gt; &lt;http://example/p&gt; &lt;http://example/o&gt; &lt;http://example/g&gt; .
</pre>

      <p>Has the same effect as:</p>

<pre class="box">
A &lt;http://example/s&gt; &lt;http://example/p&gt; &lt;http://example/o&gt; &lt;http://example/g&gt; .
</pre>

      <p>If there was no such quad in the dataset before the delta started.</p>

      <p>The quads don't need to be adjacent:</p>

<pre class="box">
A &lt;http://example/s&gt; &lt;http://example/p&gt; &lt;http://example/o&gt; &lt;http://example/g&gt; .
A &lt;http://example/other&gt; &lt;http://example/p&gt; 123 &lt;http://example/g2&gt; .
A &lt;http://example/s&gt; &lt;http://example/p&gt; &lt;http://example/o&gt; &lt;http://example/g&gt; .
</pre>

      <p>becomes</p>

<pre class="box">
A &lt;http://example/s&gt; &lt;http://example/p&gt; &lt;http://example/o&gt; &lt;http://example/g&gt; .
A &lt;http://example/other&gt; &lt;http://example/p&gt; 123 &lt;http://example/g2&gt; .
</pre>
      <p>
        When written in canonical form the RDF Patch can be run backwards,
        to undo a change.  This only works when real changes are recorded
        because otherwise knowing a triple is added does not mean it was
        not there before.

      <h2>Blank Nodes</h2>
      <p>
        Both RDF-syntax-style (document scoped labels, new blank nodes created)

        RDF provides
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#h3_section-skolemization"

      <p>Simplicity of design leads to widespread adoption,
        which is important for the core use of managing chanage to RDF
        data.  All features need to balance their utility for
        a partcular use case with the increase in complexity and

        <p>The <a href="#rdf-tuples-format">grammar</a> does not specific

          convenient even in a machine oriented format.</p>
        <p>

        <h3>Metadata</h3>
        <p>There are two metadata needs: linking and inline.</p>
        <section id="metadata-linking">
          <h4>Linking</h4>
          <p>Linking can be achieved with an <tt>L</tt> (or<tt>LINK</tt>)
            record. However, the link may be unavailable or is subject to
            change after the patch is created.

          <p>
            Inline metadata is not subject to such changes.  It is
            made a little more complicated because RDF-patch is not an RDF
            syntax (the handling of blank nodes is different).
          </p>
          <p><b>Proposal:</b> A single line of <tt>METADATA</tt> starts or
            stops a block of characters that is passed to a Turtle parser.
            Blank nodes are handled as per RDF; full Turtle readability
            idioms apply.  The block must not contain the
            string <tt>METADATA</tt> at the start of line.

        <h3>Transaction Boundaries</h3>
        <p>The RDF patch format can be used to record one set of related
          changes, a group of related changes or as a stream of changes.
          When used to record one set of relate changes, the changes
          should be applied atomically - they all happen or none of them
          happen.
        </p>
        <p class="todo">@@ As part of a section in a more formal style, add
          the atomicity requirement.</p>

        <p>We define
          atomicity as a "SHOULD" because we do not exclude the use of a
          data format just because of specific system sisues such as
          light-weight implementation or usages that do not need this
          feature.
          </p>

        <p>While (ACID) transactions do give atomicity, they are not the
          only way and are apprropriate for large systems.
        </p>

        <p>The requirement on the RDF Patch format is to have markers for
          the beginning and end of sections of changes.
        </p>


         <p><b>Proposal:</b> Add <tt>BEGIN</tt> and <tt>END</tt> to
           indicate a block of changes.  A block should be applied
           atomically.  This maybe a transaction - it depends on the
           nature of the destination.

        <dt>Security considerations:</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            RDF Patch is a general-purpose assertion language; applications
            may evaluate given data to infer more assertions or to
            dereference IRIs, invoking the security considerations of the
            scheme for that IRI. Note in particular, the privacy issues in
            [<cite><a href="#bib-RFC3023" rel="biblioentry"
            class="bibref">RFC3023</a></cite>] section 10 for HTTP
            IRIs. Data obtained from an inaccurate or malicious data source
            may lead to inaccurate or misleading conclusions, as well as
            the dereferencing of unintended IRIs. Care must be taken to
            align the trust in consulted resources with the sensitivity of
            the intended use of the data; inferences of potential medical
            treatments would likely require different trust than inferences
            for trip planning.
          </p>
          <p>
            RDF Patch is used to express arbitrary application data;
            security considerations will vary by domain of use. Security
            tools and protocols applicable to text (e.g. PGP encryption,
            MD5 sum validation, password-protected compression) may also be
            used on RDF Patch documents. Security/privacy protocols must be
            imposed which reflect the sensitivity of the embedded
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            RDF Patch can express data which is presented to the user, for
            example, <abbr title="Resource Description
            Framework">RDF</abbr> Schema labels. Application rendering
            strings retrieved from untrusted RDF Patch documents must
            ensure that malignant strings may not be used to mislead the
            reader. The security considerations in the media type
            registration for XML ([<cite><a href="#bib-RFC3023"
            rel="biblioentry" class="bibref">RFC3023</a></cite>] section
            10) provide additional guidance around the expression of
            arbitrary data and markup.

            RDF Patch uses IRIs as term identifiers. Applications
            interpreting data expressed in RDF Patch should address the

          <p>
            Multiple IRIs may have the same appearance. Characters in
            different scripts may look similar (a Cyrillic "о" may appear
            similar to a Latin "o"). A character followed by combining
            characters may have the same visual representation as another
            character (LATIN SMALL LETTER E followed by COMBINING ACUTE
            ACCENT has the same visual representation as LATIN SMALL LETTER
            E WITH ACUTE).
            </p>
          <p>
            Any person or application that is writing or interpreting data
            in RDF Patch must take care to use the IRI that matches the
            intended semantics, and avoid IRIs that make look similar.
